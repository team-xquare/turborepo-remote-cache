# Turborepo Remote Cache

This project is an open-source implementation of the [Turborepo custom remote cache server](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching#self-hosting).
If Vercel's official cache server isn't a viable option, this server is an alternative for self-hosted deployments.
It supports several storage providers and deploys environments. Moreover, the project provides **"deploy to "** buttons for one-click deployments whenever possible.
